**What are directives?**

Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. Use Angular's built-in directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.

**What are structural directives?**

Structural Directives are directives which change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements. There are three built-in structural directives, NgIf , NgFor and NgSwitch . These directives work by using the HTML 5 <ng-template> tag.

As we already seen ngFor and ngIf, we're not doing that again.

We will see ngSwitch in the upcomming commits.
